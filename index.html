                <h2>Hi, I'm Shushruth</h2>
                <p>My name is Shushruth Shivananda, and I am currently based in Frankfurt, Germany, pursuing my M.Sc. in International Logistics and Supply Chain Management at the International School of Management (ISM), with an upcoming exchange semester in Budapest.

                    I bring diverse hands-on experience in logistics operations, inventory management, and supply chain analysis through roles at Vinokilo (Germany), Amisol Global Ecoware LLP (India), and Jayadeva Modern Industries (India). My work has included inventory reconciliation, delivery tracking, production workflow analysis, and data-driven decision support to enhance operational efficiency and reduce delays.
                    Additionally, I contributed to a Hyundai Glovis Europe project focused on vendor coordination, routing optimization, and automation, where I proposed AI-based solutions to improve efficiency and transparency. My mechanical training at Bharat Earth Movers Limited also gave me grassroot exposure to vehicle inspection, road surveying, and fault analysis, enriching my understanding of end-to-end operations.

                    Equipped with technical skills in Excel, Power BI, Outlook, Word, and KPI tracking, and strong communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities, I am passionate about optimizing supply chains through data-driven and innovative approaches. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to a global supply chain and logistics team by combining practical experience, analytical mindset, and internationalÂ exposure.
